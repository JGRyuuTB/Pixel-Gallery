1. Push to `main` and download the `Pixel-Gallery-You-apk` artifact from the **Actions** tab.
2. To publish a release, create a `v1.4.2` tag and push it: the APK is attached to the Release (with the notes from `CHANGELOG.md`), and installed apps will offer it as an update.

cd Pixel-Gallery
gradle assembleRelease   # requires JDK 17
```
